# Xbox controller mapper

For some peculiar reason Doom 1 & 2 implemented in [Doom 3: BFG Edition](https://store.steampowered.com/app/208200/Doom_3_BFG_Edition/) don't come with an option to remap gamepad controls. Alas, changes that I introduced in native config files didn't take effect after I run the game. Moreover, I was astounded to discover that [my favourite gamepad mapper](https://www.xpadder.com) is paid software. Strange. I thought to myself that duplicating it's core functionality would fit my skill level just perfectly and I decided to write this utility. *I should probably stick a note somewhere that warns me of starting the next "weekend project that would require me just one day to finish".*
